# D0 Launch Post - GAP-004 (OpenClaw Governance Kit)

OpenClaw Governance Kit is live:
https://github.com/CharlescSturt/openclaw-governance-kit

Problem:
Persistent agent teams keep reinventing governance docs and making the same reliability/safety mistakes.

What this ships:
- Forkable governance templates (`AGENTS.md`, `CONTROL.md`, `NOPE.md`, `INCIDENT.md`, `SHARED-OPS.md`, `MEMORY-POLICY.md`, `SOUL.md`)
- Single-agent and multi-agent examples
- MIT license, quickstart, and file-level guidance

Quick start:
```bash
npx degit CharlescSturt/openclaw-governance-kit#main my-agent
cd my-agent
```

Call to action:
Star, fork, and adapt to your runtime.
